            conference='MinRoot VDF event 2023, Lyon'
            workshop='Analysis of candidate sequential function MinRoot'
          >
           Between April 28th and 30th, 2023, the Ethereum Foundation invited a group of researchers to conduct an initial analysis of the candidate sequential function MinRoot. 
               The purpose of this gathering was to collectively delve into the intricacies of MinRoot and assess its potential implications for the Ethereum ecosystem. 
               Preliminary analysis was conducted by Gaetan Leurent, Maria Naya Plasencia, and Stefano Tessaro. At the event, the researchers were divided into three groups,
               each tasked with different aspects of MinRoot's evaluation. The resulting report serves as a comprehensive joint summary, presenting the culmination of the researchers' intensive efforts during the event.

            workshop='Open Problems in Decentralized Computation at Eurocrypt 2022'
          >
            this workshop brings the most interesting and challenging open cryptographic questions
            that Ethereum, Filecoin and other blockchain systems face, to the attention of academia.
            We will cover a large spectrum of research topics, such as vector commitments, SNARKs,
            shuffles, authenticated data structures and more. We will start the day with an update
            on to the problems discussed at last year&apos;s workshop.
